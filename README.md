# Digital Biomarkers for Parkinson’s Disease 
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting approximately one million Americans. Despite the prevalence of PD, the diagnosis and long-term monitoring of this disease is limited and subjective, mainly assessed via clinical observations and patients’ descriptions. Recent advances in digital health approaches such as wearables, phones, and smartwatches provide opportunities to collect rich and objective real-word data. In the JHU Data Science Fellows Program, my goal is to identify sets of digital biomarkers for PD using MJFF Levodopa Wearable Sensors Dataset.
